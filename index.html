 // Understand -
    // Create a rock paper scissors game that plays to 5 rounds and exits. It will keep score throughout and give winner at the end. where computer has random selection, and user inputs an answer.
// Plan - 
    // get prompt from user for choice, use console.log() to display results



    // Algo and Divide -

        // name list with choices. Declare computerSelection as function computerPlay,
