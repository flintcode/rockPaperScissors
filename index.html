<!-- 
Understand -
     Create a rock paper scissors game that plays to 5 rounds and exits. It will keep score throughout and give winner at the end. where computer has random selection, and user inputs an answer.
Plan - 
     get prompt from user for choice, use console.log() to display results -->

     <!-- // Algorithim  
     // write a function taking parameters playerSelection and computerSelection then declares winner with a string
     // write conditionals for choices of playerSelection vs computerSelection
     // if  a player win condition, then alert a +1 increase in the playerScore and vice versa for computer
   -->
